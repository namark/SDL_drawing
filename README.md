# SDL_drawing
An OO wrapper library for SDL1.2. It is not at all complete, I just add functionality as I need for my projects.

### Installation

__sudo make install__ will install in /usr/local.<br />
Keep the makefile to be able to __sudo make unisntall__.<br />
Alternatively, use __checkinstall__ if available.

### Usage
```c++ 
#include <SDL_drawing/desiredHeaderFile.h> 
```
Link with ```-lSDL_drawing```
